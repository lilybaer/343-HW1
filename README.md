Git provides numerous commands that assist in the interaction between the command line and GitHub. "git init" is used to intitalize a git repsoitory, which is the first step and "git status" is a way to check to see which files are known to git. In order to move files from a local terminal to GitHub, you would use "git add" to add the files you wish to move, "git commit" packages these files into a commit, and "git push" is what pushes this commit to your Github. If you wish to add a branch, you use "git checkout -b" with the name of the branch, and git branch is used to display all of the branches as well as your current branch.
